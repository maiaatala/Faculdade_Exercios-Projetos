I understand your problem.

But i need to remind you we haven't actually talked for months. To me you have been taking a break from talking to me for months now.

And I don't do well with the hot-and-cold and the lack of routine and the lack of attention, call it trauma, call it drama, call it whatever you want

But I cant ask for you to do something that is causing you dread and/or pain I understand that sometimes we need to do what is the best for us, even if it is not the best for those around us

I hope you can find a way to balance real life and online life. I love you, I always will, but please don't put me in the middle of this... whatever it is.
